  This repository contains the source code of the Open
  Source Geo-spatial Energy Modeller (OSGEM), a hybrid
  modelling tool comprising of code from OSeMOSYS,
  specifically from an OSeMOSYS-PuLP implementation by the
  State_of_Goa repository, and (OnSSET). This model was
  applied to a country case of Burkina Faso and was created
  in conjuction with a Master's thesis by the author. Data
  for that case can be found in this repository and the
  thesis can be found here (link to be added upon thesis
  completion).
